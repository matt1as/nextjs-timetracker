# Next.js Time Tracker

A simple, elegant time tracking application built with Next.js that helps professionals and teams track their time spent on projects and activities.

## Why Simple Time Tracking?

In today's fast-paced professional environment, time tracking is essential for productivity, billing, and resource management. However, many enterprise time tracking solutions are:

- **Overly complex** with features most users never need
- **Difficult to navigate** with cluttered interfaces
- **Expensive** with subscription models that don't make sense for individuals or small teams
- **Slow to use** requiring too many clicks to complete simple tasks

This application aims to solve these pain points by providing:

- A **clean, minimalist interface** focused on quick entry and retrieval
- **Project-based organization** that makes sense for most workflows
- **Offline-first approach** allowing you to track time even without internet
- **Zero learning curve** so you can start tracking immediately

## Features

- Create and manage projects
- Add activities to projects
- Log time entries against activities
- View time reports by project and activity
- Simple data export for billing and analysis

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
